mrt-timing-01.sh and mrt_ folders relate to Part II: Reproduce RSFgen

mrt-timing-02.sh and mrt_ini folders relate to Part II: Control ITI

mrt-timing-03.sh and mrt_lnr folders relate to Part II: Limit the number of repetitions

Unfortunately I ran out of time, so I wasn't able start on Part III yet, but I intend to complete and push that later just so I can make sure I'm doing that stuff correctly, even if I can't get the credit for it.

The scripts are messy, but I'm aware of that and intend to clean them up later.

### Q1

The structure of the best designed was spaced out fairly evenly, there weren't many clusters of stimuli.  If the stimuli are clustered the BOLD signal fails to settle after each stimulus, making it more difficult to detect a signicant BOLD effect.

### Q2

Terminal crashed halfway through the 5000 iterations and I don't have time to try running it again, so this is based on 500.

Stimuli are much more evenly distributed due to having intervals between.

### Q3

Based on 250 iterations due to time.

Not only are the stimuli more spaced out temporally, but they are ordered much more effectively.  The same stimulus doesn't occur consecutively.

### Q4

Optimal designs offer stimuli that are evenly spaced and non-consecutive, meaning stimuli of the same type do not occur back-to-back.
